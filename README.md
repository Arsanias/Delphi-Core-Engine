# Delphi-Core-Engine

Copy the the Core Engine files to your typical VCL directory and add the path to your Delphi Search Path (Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Delphi Options -> Search Path). 

Example:

You have copied the files to "C:\Users\\{your name}\Documents\RAD Studio\Vcl\".
Now go to options and add following lines to the Search Path 

"C:\Users\\{your name}\Documents\RAD Studio\Vcl\Core\Source"

"C:\Users\\{your name}\Documents\RAD Studio\Vcl\Core\DirectX"
